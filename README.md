# Credit-Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The goal is to classify whether a given transaction is legitimate or fraudulent based on features extracted from the transaction data. The dataset contains anonymized features, making it suitable for building predictive models while respecting user privacy.

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: The project uses a dataset containing anonymized credit card transaction features.
- **Machine Learning Models**: It employs algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes steps like feature scaling, handling imbalanced data, and data transformation.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: This project requires Python 3.x. Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment.

2. **Install Dependencies**: You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`. Run the following command to install all dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project

After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, you can run the code as follows:

```bash
python fraud_detection_model.py
```

The model will train on the dataset and output the performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

### 1. Load the Dataset

The dataset (`credit_card_transactions.csv`) can be found in the `data/` folder. It is preprocessed using techniques like normalization and imbalanced data handling.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('data/credit_card_transactions.csv')
```

### 2. Train the Model

The project uses different machine learning models to classify transactions:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Train-test split
X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)  # Features
y = data['Class']  # Target variable (fraudulent or legitimate)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

### 3. Model Evaluation

Evaluate your model's performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+card+fraud+detection). The dataset contains:
- 30 features (anonymized) and 1 target column (`Class`) indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (`1`) or legitimate (`0`).
- The dataset has class imbalance, with fraud cases being much less frequent than legitimate ones.

## Results

The project achieved the following results:

- **Accuracy**: 98.5%
- **Precision**: 0.99
- **Recall**: 0.85
- **F1-score**: 0.92

This shows that while the model performs well overall, it could potentially be improved by balancing the classes or using more advanced models like XGBoost or deep learning techniques.

## Technologies

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and tools
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing data and model performance
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **imbalanced-learn**: To handle imbalanced classes

### Key Notes:
1. **Ensure the Dataset and Files are Linked Properly**: If your dataset is available in the `data` folder, make sure the paths in the script align with the project structure.
   
2. **Visualizations**: If your project includes visualizations (e.g., feature distributions or performance metrics), you can add a "Visualizations" section and explain how the plots help in understanding the results.

3. **Requirements File**: It's common to include a `requirements.txt` file with the exact versions of the libraries you used. Here's a simple example:

    ```
    pandas==1.2.3
    scikit-learn==0.24.1
    matplotlib==3.4.1
    seaborn==0.11.1
    imbalanced-learn==0.8.0
    ```

### Customizing the Template:
- **Results**: Tailor the `Results` section based on the actual outcomes of your project.
- **License**: Make sure the license matches what you're using (MIT, GPL, etc.).
- **Technologies**: If you're using different libraries or frameworks, update the `Technologies` section accordingly.
